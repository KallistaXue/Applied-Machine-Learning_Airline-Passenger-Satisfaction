COMS-W4995 Applied Machine Learning Project
The project assignment gives students an opportunity to apply different aspects of Machine Learning covered in the classroom to a real-world application. 
Through this project, students will get hands-on experience solving a Machine Learning problem including data analysis, 
visualization and applying machine learning models to develop actionable insights. 
The project will have three deliverables that are required to be submitted by the team throughout the course term. 
The students are randomly assigned to groups sized 4-6 and would be allowed one submission per group.
